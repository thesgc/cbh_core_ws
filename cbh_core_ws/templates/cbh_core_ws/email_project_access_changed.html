<p>Hi {{user.first_name}} {{user.last_name}}</p>

<p>Your permissions on the following projects on the ChemBio Hub platform have been changed by {{extra.invite.created_by.first_name }} {{invite.created_by.last_name }}:</p>


<p><ul>
    {% for project in extra.invite.projects_selected %}
    <li>{{ project.name }} reader</li>
    {% endfor %}
</ul></p>

<p>You can now access these projects at the usual address:
