<p>You can now access these projects at the usual address:
<br>
{{ extra.login_url }}</p>

<p>If you would like to reset your password you can do it via this link:<br>
<a href="{{ protocol }}://{{ domain }}{% url 'password_reset_confirm' uidb64=uid token=token %}">{{ protocol }}://{{ domain }}{% url 'password_reset_confirm' uidb64=uid token=token %}</a>
